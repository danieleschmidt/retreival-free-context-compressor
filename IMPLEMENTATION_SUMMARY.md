## 📋 Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following steps require manual intervention:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
Copy workflow templates from `docs/workflows/implementations/` to `.github/workflows/`:
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration with multi-version testing
- `security.yml` - SAST scanning, dependency checks, secret detection
- `docker.yml` - Multi-platform container builds with security scanning
- `release.yml` - Automated semantic releases
- `dependency-review.yml` - Automated dependency risk assessment
- `performance.yml` - Performance regression testing

### 2. Repository Secrets Configuration
Configure the following secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Code coverage reporting
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - PyPI package publishing
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Container registry
- `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` / `COSIGN_PASSWORD` - Image signing (optional)

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
Configure branch protection for `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews (1+ reviewers)
- Require status checks: lint, test matrix, build, security scans
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- Include administrators in restrictions
