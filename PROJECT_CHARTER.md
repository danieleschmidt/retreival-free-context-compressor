# Project Charter: Retrieval-Free Context Compressor

## Executive Summary

The Retrieval-Free Context Compressor (RFCC) is an open-source PyTorch library that enables efficient processing of long-context documents (256k+ tokens) by compressing them into dense "mega-tokens" while preserving semantic information and task performance. This project eliminates the complexity and latency of external retrieval systems while achieving superior performance on question-answering and text generation tasks.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core Compression Engine**: Hierarchical document compression using information bottleneck principles
- **Framework Integrations**: Seamless integration with HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, and OpenAI APIs
- **Training Infrastructure**: Multi-objective training framework for custom compression models
- **Evaluation Suite**: Comprehensive benchmarking tools for compression quality and performance
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time compression for infinite context scenarios
- **Production Tools**: Docker containers, monitoring, and deployment utilities

### Out of Scope
- **Proprietary Model Hosting**: Cloud-based compression services (focus on open-source tooling)
- **Hardware Development**: Custom chips or hardware acceleration beyond standard GPU support
- **Data Collection**: Large-scale data harvesting or proprietary dataset creation
- **Commercial Licensing**: Enterprise support contracts (community-driven support model)

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
1. **Compression Performance**: Achieve 8× compression ratio with <5% F1 score degradation vs. full context
2. **Inference Speed**: Process 256k token documents in <500ms on consumer GPU hardware
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce memory usage by 50%+ compared to full context processing
4. **Quality Benchmarks**: Match or exceed RAG baselines on 5+ standard QA datasets
5. **Framework Integration**: Provide production-ready plugins for top 3 LLM frameworks

### Adoption Goals
1. **Community Growth**: 10k GitHub stars and 1k contributors within 18 months
2. **Production Usage**: 100+ organizations using RFCC in production environments
3. **Academic Impact**: Research paper accepted at top-tier AI conference (ACL, NeurIPS, ICLR)
4. **Open Source Health**: 95%+ test coverage, <1 week median issue resolution time
5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Official integration with 3+ major LLM platforms

### User Experience Targets
1. **Developer Onboarding**: Complete setup and first compression in <30 minutes
2. **API Usability**: Single-line integration for basic compression use cases
3. **Documentation Quality**: 95%+ positive feedback on documentation completeness
4. **Performance Transparency**: Real-time metrics and explainability for compression decisions
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation and helpful error messages for edge cases
