# Project Charter: Retrieval-Free Context Compressor

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Active  

## Executive Summary

The Retrieval-Free Context Compressor project aims to revolutionize long-context processing for Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing the breakthrough compression techniques from ACL-25. This project eliminates the need for external retrieval systems while achieving superior compression ratios and maintaining or improving downstream task performance.
