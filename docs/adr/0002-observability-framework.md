# ADR-0002: Observability and Monitoring Framework

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Deciders:** DevOps Team, Core Development Team

## Context

The retrieval-free context compressor operates with complex hierarchical processing and needs comprehensive observability to:
- Monitor compression quality and performance in production
- Debug compression failures and quality degradation
- Track resource usage across different compression ratios
- Provide insights into which content gets compressed and how
- Enable performance optimization and capacity planning

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered observability framework with:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Latency, throughput, memory usage tracking
2. **Quality Metrics**: Compression ratio, information retention scores, F1 degradation
3. **Operational Metrics**: Error rates, retry patterns, queue depths
4. **Business Metrics**: Usage patterns, compression effectiveness by content type
5. **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing through compression pipeline
6. **Structured Logging**: Contextual logs with compression metadata

Technology stack:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: Prometheus AlertManager + PagerDuty integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Real-time visibility into compression performance and quality
- Proactive issue detection through comprehensive alerting
- Data-driven optimization opportunities
- Enhanced debugging capabilities for complex compression issues
- Clear performance baselines and regression detection

### Negative
- Additional operational complexity and infrastructure requirements
- Performance overhead from instrumentation (estimated 2-5%)
- Increased storage costs for metrics and traces
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with observability tools

### Neutral
- Requires ongoing maintenance of dashboards and alerts
- Creates dependency on observability infrastructure
- Necessitates standardized metric definitions across team

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Basic Application Logging Only
- **Description:** Simple file-based logging with minimal metrics
- **Pros:** Low complexity, minimal overhead, no external dependencies
- **Cons:** Limited visibility, reactive debugging only, no performance insights
- **Why rejected:** Insufficient for production operation of complex ML system

### Option 2: Cloud Provider Native Solutions (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Monitoring)
- **Description:** Use cloud provider's built-in observability services
- **Pros:** Integrated with infrastructure, managed service, good defaults
- **Cons:** Vendor lock-in, limited customization, higher costs at scale
- **Why rejected:** Want vendor-agnostic solution for multi-cloud flexibility

### Option 3: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Description:** Traditional logging-focused observability stack
- **Pros:** Mature ecosystem, powerful search capabilities, familiar to many teams
- **Cons:** Heavy resource requirements, complex operational overhead, limited metrics/tracing
- **Why rejected:** Overkill for metrics/tracing needs, high operational burden

## Implementation Notes

- Use OpenTelemetry Python SDK for instrumentation
- Implement custom metrics for compression-specific KPIs
- Set up automated dashboards for different user personas (dev, ops, business)
- Configure alerting thresholds based on SLA requirements
- Include compression quality degradation alerts
- Implement sampling for high-volume trace collection
- Use structured logging with consistent field naming

Key metrics to track:
- `compression_ratio_actual` vs `compression_ratio_target`
- `compression_latency_p99` across different input sizes
- `information_retention_score` by content type
- `memory_peak_usage` during compression
- `error_rate` by compression operation type
