# ADR-0003: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Deciders:** QA Team, Core Development Team

## Context

The retrieval-free context compressor is a complex ML system that requires comprehensive testing to ensure:
- Compression quality and consistency across different content types
- Performance characteristics under various load conditions
- Reliability and error handling in production scenarios
- Backward compatibility when models are updated
- Security against adversarial inputs

The system involves multiple components (hierarchical encoders, routing mechanisms, streaming compression) that need different testing approaches.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end compression pipeline testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark testing with pytest-benchmark
4. **Property-Based Tests**: Hypothesis-driven testing for edge cases
5. **Quality Regression Tests**: Continuous validation of compression quality
6. **Security Tests**: Input validation and adversarial robustness testing
7. **Contract Tests**: API contract validation for external integrations

Testing framework stack:
- **Core**: pytest with extensive fixtures and plugins
- **Performance**: pytest-benchmark for regression detection
- **Property-based**: Hypothesis for generative testing
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov with 85% minimum coverage requirement
- **Quality**: Custom compression quality evaluation suite
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with matrix testing across Python versions

## Consequences

### Positive
- High confidence in compression quality and performance
- Early detection of regressions through automated testing
- Comprehensive edge case coverage through property-based testing
- Clear performance baselines and regression detection
- Robust error handling and input validation

### Negative
- Significant test development and maintenance overhead
- Longer CI/CD pipeline execution times
- Complex test data management for quality tests
- Higher computational requirements for performance testing

### Neutral
- Requires discipline to maintain test coverage standards
- Creates dependency on external test data sources
- Necessitates regular test suite optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Basic Unit Testing Only
- **Description:** Simple unit tests without integration or performance testing
- **Pros:** Fast execution, low maintenance, simple implementation
- **Cons:** Limited coverage, no performance regression detection, poor integration validation
- **Why rejected:** Insufficient for complex ML system with quality requirements

### Option 2: Manual Testing Focus
- **Description:** Primarily manual testing with minimal automation
- **Pros:** Flexible, good for exploratory testing, lower initial investment
- **Cons:** Not scalable, prone to human error, no continuous validation
- **Why rejected:** Cannot maintain quality at development velocity required

### Option 3: ML-Specific Testing Only
- **Description:** Focus only on model quality and performance testing
- **Pros:** Domain-specific, directly relevant to core functionality
- **Cons:** Misses integration issues, security vulnerabilities, API contracts
- **Why rejected:** Leaves too many potential failure modes uncovered

## Implementation Notes

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/                    # Fast unit tests (< 1s each)
├── integration/            # End-to-end tests (< 30s each)
├── performance/            # Benchmark tests with baseline comparison
├── property/               # Hypothesis-based property tests
├── quality/                # Compression quality regression tests
├── security/               # Security and robustness tests
├── fixtures/               # Shared test data and fixtures
└── conftest.py            # Pytest configuration and global fixtures
```

### Key Testing Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% line coverage, 90% for core compression logic
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Track compression latency, memory usage, throughput
- **Quality Thresholds**: F1 score degradation < 5% for standard test sets
- **Property Tests**: Input validation, compression invariants, streaming consistency
- **Integration Tests**: Full pipeline tests with realistic data volumes

### Test Data Strategy
- Use synthetic data for unit tests (fast, deterministic)
- Include representative real-world samples for integration tests
- Maintain golden datasets for quality regression testing
- Implement data versioning for reproducible test results

### CI/CD Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Performance tests on main branch only (resource intensive)
- Quality regression tests on release candidates
- Security tests on external dependencies updates
