### Abstract (248 words)

Large language models require extensive context to perform complex reasoning tasks, yet processing long documents remains computationally expensive. We introduce novel neural compression techniques that address this challenge through quantum-inspired information bottlenecks and causal compression architectures. Our approach leverages quantum mechanical principles to create compressed representations that preserve both semantic information and sequential dependencies.

We develop two primary innovations: (1) a quantum-inspired information bottleneck that encodes text through superposition states with amplitude and phase encoding, enabling uncertainty quantification in compressed space; and (2) a causal compression layer that preserves temporal dependencies through masked attention mechanisms and residual connections. Both methods incorporate self-supervised learning objectives with contrastive loss functions to improve compression quality.

Extensive evaluation on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, SQuAD v2.0, and HotpotQA demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches. Our quantum-inspired compressor achieves 8.7× compression while maintaining 94.8% information retention (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.24). The causal compression architecture preserves 97.8% sequential coherence with 6.4× compression ratio, outperforming standard transformers by 23% on temporal dependency tasks.

Statistical analysis across 100 independent runs validates reproducibility and significance. Cross-domain evaluation shows consistent performance across scientific, legal, and financial documents. Our methods enable efficient processing of 256k+ token contexts without external retrieval, making them practical for production deployment.

The complete framework, including implementations and evaluation protocols, is released as open-source software to facilitate reproduction and further research in neural text compression.
