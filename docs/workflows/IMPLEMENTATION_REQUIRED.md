# GitHub Actions Implementation Required

This repository has comprehensive workflow documentation but is missing the actual GitHub Actions YAML files. The following workflows need to be implemented in `.github/workflows/`:

## Critical Workflows to Implement

### 1. ci.yml - Main CI Pipeline
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -e .[dev]
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=retrieval_free --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 2. security.yml - Security Scanning
```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
      - name: Upload Trivy scan results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### 3. release.yml - Automated Releases
```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - name: Build package
        run: |
          pip install build
          python -m build
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add the workflow files above
3. Configure repository secrets:
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` for PyPI publishing
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting
4. Enable branch protection rules
5. Configure security alerts and dependency scanning

## Current Status
- ❌ No workflow files exist
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive
- ❌ Secrets not configured
- ❌ Branch protection not enabled

**Action Required**: Create actual workflow files based on the templates above.
