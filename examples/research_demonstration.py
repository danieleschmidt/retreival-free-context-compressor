        Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression using 
        information-theoretic principles. We demonstrate that by applying the information 
        bottleneck principle, we can achieve significant compression ratios while maintaining 
        model performance. Our experiments show 8x compression with minimal accuracy loss 
        on benchmark datasets. The method is theoretically grounded and practically efficient.
        
        Introduction: The exponential growth of neural network sizes has created challenges 
        for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Traditional compression methods 
        focus on reducing parameter counts but may not optimally preserve task-relevant 
        information. Our approach leverages information theory to identify and preserve 
        the most critical information pathways while eliminating redundancy.
        """,
        """
        Related Work: Previous approaches to neural compression include pruning, quantization, 
        and knowledge distillation. Pruning methods remove less important connections based 
        on magnitude or gradient information. Quantization reduces precision of weights and 
        activations. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from large teacher models 
        to smaller student models. However, these methods often lack theoretical foundations 
        for determining what information to preserve.
        
        Methodology: Our approach is based on the information bottleneck principle, which 
        seeks to find representations that maximize relevant information while minimizing 
        irrelevant information. We formulate compression as an optimization problem that 
        balances information preservation and compression ratio.
        """,
        """
        Experiments: We evaluate our method on three benchmark tasks: image classification, 
        natural language processing, and speech recognition. For each task, we compare 
        against state-of-the-art compression baselines including magnitude-based pruning, 
        lottery ticket hypothesis, and progressive shrinking. Our method consistently 
        outperforms baselines across all metrics.
        
        Results: On ImageNet classification, we achieve 91.2% top-1 accuracy with 8.5x 
        compression, compared to 89.7% for the best baseline. On GLUE benchmarks, our 
        compressed models maintain 97.3% of original performance while reducing size by 
        12x. Statistical significance tests confirm these improvements are not due to chance.

        API Reference: The ContextCompressor class provides the main interface for text 
        compression. It supports multiple compression algorithms including hierarchical 
        encoding, semantic clustering, and adaptive bit allocation. The compress() method 
        takes text input and returns a CompressionResult object containing mega-tokens 
        and metadata about the compression process.
        
        Parameters: compression_ratio (float): Target compression ratio, defaults to 8.0. 
        algorithm (str): Compression algorithm to use, options are 'hierarchical', 
        'semantic', 'adaptive'. enable_caching (bool): Whether to cache intermediate 
        results for faster subsequent compressions. max_tokens (int): Maximum number of 
        mega-tokens to generate, defaults to None for automatic determination.

        """
        Installation Guide: The system requires Python 3.10 or higher and PyTorch 2.3+. 
        GPU support is optional but recommended for large-scale compression tasks. 
        Install using pip install retrieval-free-context-compressor. For development 
        installation, clone the repository and run pip install -e . in the project directory.
        
        Dependencies: The core system depends on transformers, einops, scikit-learn, and 
        sentence-transformers. Optional dependencies include flash-attn for GPU acceleration, 
        faiss-gpu for similarity search, and ray for distributed processing. See pyproject.toml 
        for complete dependency information.
        """,
        """
        Configuration: The system can be configured through environment variables or 
        configuration files. Key settings include COMPRESSION_CACHE_DIR for cache location, 
        COMPRESSION_DEVICE for compute device selection, and COMPRESSION_LOG_LEVEL for 
        logging verbosity. Configuration files use YAML format and support sections for 
        compression, caching, monitoring, and deployment settings.
        
        Performance Tuning: For optimal performance, consider enabling GPU acceleration, 
        adjusting batch sizes based on available memory, and using distributed processing 
        for large workloads. Monitor memory usage and adjust compression parameters to 
        balance ratio and processing time. The system includes built-in profiling tools 
        to identify bottlenecks.
